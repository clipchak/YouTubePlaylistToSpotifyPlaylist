# YouTubePlaylistToSpotifyPlaylist
A Python script that can turn any public YouTube song playlist into a Spotify playlist. This project is based on a [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J_qcttfnJA) that took a person's "liked video" playlist on YouTube and turned it into a Spotify playlist.

# YouTubePlaylistToSpotifyPlaylist
This project is based on [TheComeUp's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J_qcttfnJA) that took a person's "liked video" playlist on YouTube and turned it into a Spotify playlist. I made my own project based on that tutorial and code that can instead take any public YouTube song playlist and move it to Spotify.

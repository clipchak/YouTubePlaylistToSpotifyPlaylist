# YouTubePlaylistToSpotifyPlaylist
This project is based on [TheComeUp's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J_qcttfnJA) that took a person's "liked video" playlist on YouTube and turned it into a Spotify playlist. The difference between TheComeUp's project and this project is: 
- can take **any** public YouTube song playlist and move it to Spotify (not just liked videos)
- loops through to include **every** song on the playlist (not just first n results)
- you don't have to go through the confusing/difficult process of authorizing a YouTube account because this uses publically available information

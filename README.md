# YouTubePlaylistToSpotifyPlaylist
This project is based on [TheComeUp's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J_qcttfnJA) that took a person's "liked video" playlist on YouTube and turned it into a Spotify playlist. The difference between [TheComeUp's project](https://github.com/TheComeUpCode/SpotifyGeneratePlaylist) and this project is: 
- Can take **any** public YouTube song playlist and move it to Spotify (not just liked videos)
- Loops through to include **every** song on the playlist
- You don't have to go through the confusing/difficult process of authorizing a YouTube account (uses publically available information)
- Uses Facebook's web crawler for more reliability
